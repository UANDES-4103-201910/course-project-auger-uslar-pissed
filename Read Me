Our application fulfills the function of having all the views in addition to connecting them together, added to this we have several functional windows, as well as all views of User and Post. We try to get as close as possible to the views made in the last delivery in the Axure software, but the changes made was because we progressed with the task, we realized that we could improve the views and some were necessary, since they were made of Different forms with the codes, for example comment threads, is simply to apply "buttons" or "submits" in the posts and comments, so we do not consider it necessary to make an exclusive view of that.
